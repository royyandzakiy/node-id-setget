# Node ID Set and Get

A project made to give a certain node (ESP32) a ID which is saved within it's NVS (Non-Volatile Storage).

This is important if such information is needed to be kept even after a device is restarted.

Made by developing the [Espressif NVS example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/8bc19ba/examples/storage/nvs_rw_value)
